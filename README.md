<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
Designed and developed for Bucknell University's Mobile Computing course, "Jonny's Pizza" is an Android mobile application that allows users to order items from a fictitious pizza restaurant called Jonny's Pizza. These items include custom pizzas, subs, wings, and drinks. Orders may be either delivery or carryout, and all users must create a personal account so that an order history can be maintained. After users place an order, it will appear in their order history so that in the future they can quickly re-order or create a new order that starts with the items of the previous order.

<h4>How to Get Started</h4>

In order to use this mobile app, the backend code must be running so that users and orders can be stored and retrieved from the database.  For information and to view the backend code, click <a href="https://replit.com/@JonathanBasom/Jonnys-Pizza-Backend?v=1">here</a>.
